## Pull requests

Adhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work
merged:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repo, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/multisms
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd multisms
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mustafagenc/multisms.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull upstream dev
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream dev
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

10. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.
